The Routing Model looks through 6 possible routes from one city to another with particular constraints such as particular sub-stops in each route. The aim is to decide a route that will minimize the amount of time and fuel used from the city to city trip. 


The Scheduling Model looks at 5 city to city trips with different timings and 5 drivers at service. The aim is to assign drivers in such a way that can optimize the trips scheduling by decreasing the driver's downtime while still respecting the state approved rest times. 


The White Wine AI code uses keras package from tensorflow to see whether a regression model or a classification model can accurately predict white wine's quality which has a rating between 1-10. Experiments were done to see the most accurate number of epochs, batch size, activation, optimizer etc. The code looked at the models' MSE and MAE to see which model is better for the dataset.
