The Scheduling Model looks at 5 city to city trips with different timings and 5 drivers at service. The aim is to assign drivers in such a way that can optimize the trips scheduling by decreasing the driver's downtime while still respecting the state approved rest times. 

The Routing Model looks through 6 possible routes from one city to another with particular constraints such as particular sub-stops in each route. The aim is to decide a route that will minimize the amount of time and fuel used from the city to city trip.
